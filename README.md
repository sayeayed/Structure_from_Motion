Attempted implementation and custom library for SfM

## **Summary**
This repository containts a first attempt at completing a SfM module, using images from http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/datasets/, of the Notre Dame cathedral. It also contains the beginnings of a custom python package (library) to implement SfM from a similar dataset.
As time goes on, this repository will be updated to improve the SfM implementation and complete the package. 

## Disclaimer
I have no prior experience with SfM, so hold on because it's going to be a bumpy ride!
