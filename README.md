Attempted implementation and custom library for SfM

## **Summary**
This repository containts a first attempt at completing a SfM module, using images from http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/datasets/, of the Notre Dame cathedral. It also contains the beginnings of a custom python package (library) to implement SfM from a similar dataset.
As time goes on, this repository will be updated to improve the SfM implementation and complete the package. 

## Disclaimer
I have no prior experience with SfM, so hold on because it's going to be a bumpy ride!

## **Required Libraries**
To run the files in this repository, the following libraries/packages must be installed:
- `numpy
- `os
- `cv2
Note: In order to run the test code, you must copy the "images" folder from the original dataset at http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/datasets/ into the directory NotreDame/NotreDame/
